The main idea is that 'goodguy' (kids) are able to squirt 'badguys' (adults) with water drops.

I created this game in February 2013 while teaching my friend about OOP. I never used processing before but I find it easy to educate a beginner without bloating his workstation with complicated IDE environments. Its more like PoC and fun. The game could be expanded with levels, scores, lives... but it would be no fun for my 2y/o and 4y/o by now. Maybe in the future if kids would be leaning toward coding skills.

Usage: arrow keys for movement, space to squirt waterdrops, keys 1 to 9 (depends on array of badguys) to spawn new 'enemies'.
